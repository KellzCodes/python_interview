# Object-Oriented Programming

Programming languages are often classified based on their syntax, features, and execution models. This course introduces you to the idea of programming paradigms and gives you an in-depth look into one of the most popular ways to think about and organize your programs.

**Object** 

`object` is the class that all other classes inherit from, even if it wasn't declared explicitly by the programmer. Almost everything in Python is an object, including `function`s, `list`s, `int`s, and all other instances of built in data types. An object's type is defined by the cass that was used to instantiate it. For example, the assignment `x = 1` creates a new object with type `int` containing with value `1`.

**Class**

In programming, a `class` can be thought of as a template or a blueprint for the creation of objects. The type of an object is the class that was used to create it. Classes define the attributes and methods (i.e. the behavior) of objects that are instantiated using them.
